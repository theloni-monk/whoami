A portfolio / reference page for me, Theo Cooper.

----------------------

## Basic Info:
Built with the NextJs framework and Github's Primer design system.
All components can be found in src/components and pages in src/pages.

The contact page uses the emailjs api to send emails from a static site.

This site is hosted by Vercel on my personal domain theloniouscoop.dev.

Like to know more? Contact me through the website or one of the links I have posted there.

----------------------

***side note:*** this website is pretty blatantly over-engineered, I could achieve the same thing with jquery and some bootstrap, but I wanted to demonstrate my proficency with more scalable web technologies like NextJs.
